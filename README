A two-player catching falling plates game, programmed in JAVA, and JavaFX.
there are a set of colored plates queues that end up falling down. Players try to catch the falling plates, if they
manage to collect three consecutive plates of the same color, then they are vanished and their score increases.

Not only plates are used, The shapes classes are dynamically loaded at the start of the execution from a specific folder

The following patterns are used in the design:
1. Singleton,
2. Factory or Pool,
3. Iterator,
4. Dynamic Linkage,
5. Snapshot,
6. State,
7. Strategy,
8. Observer,
9. MVC
10. Object Pool
11. MVC

Complete log of the operations are done on the game (e.g., user actions, objects intersections,
creation or reusing of objects) using Log4J
